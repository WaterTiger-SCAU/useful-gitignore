### Hello .gitignore

> Collected some commonly used gitignore files, more tailored to personal use. XD



##### How to use

The ***gitignore file*** of the repository has already been categorized based on tags, such as `Idea`, `mac`, `windows`, etc.

You can search for the tags which you need.

```shell
# Step 1
Make sure you are in the project path

# Step 2
grep -A [n] [tag] .gitignore
```
